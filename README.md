is a boilerplate for React JS app development with the tool and utility being taken care off by Tailwind 3 CSS library

PS. Maybe better to be using yarn, but I am not sure if it is a good idea to use it.

ideally start the project repository with yarn, and build with yarn too (if you are using yarn) like this: `yarn && yarn build`

1. `git clone github.com/dadavinci/react-tailwind-3`
2. `cd react-tailwind-3`
3. `yarn install`
4. `yarn add tailwindcss`
5. `yarn add react-tailwind-ui`
6. `yarn start`

open the browser and go to http://localhost:3000/ to see your app
